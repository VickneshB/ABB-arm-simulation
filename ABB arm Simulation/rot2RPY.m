% FUNCTION NAME: rpy2Rot %Rotation Matrix for Rotation along
% Z(roll),Y(pitch),Z(yaw).
% 
%  [R_y] = rotY(theta) using the convention below, the matrix
%  rotates points in the z-plane counterclockwise through an 
%  angle roll and in the y-plane counterclockwise through an 
%  angle pitch and in the x-plane counterclockwise through an 
%  angle yaw and about the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system.
% 
% 
% yaw = Angle to which it is Rotated along Z
% pitch = Angle to which it is Rotated along Y
% roll = Angle to which it is Rotated along X 
%
% R = Rotation Matrix for rotation along Z and then along Y and then along X.
